Our daily COVID-19 patient report combines data from both Sarasota Memorial Hospital-Sarasota Campus and SMH-Venice. Although both hospitals have seen patient-volume increases, they are operating at normal capacity at this time and are effectively managing the current COVID surge.
Includes hospitalized patients who are positive for COVID-19 and those cleared of infection but still hospitalized at SMH facilities.
Total COVID inpatients today: 36 (44 yesterday)
COVID patients in ICU: 9 (9 yesterday)
% Unvaccinated Inpatients*: 75% (updated weekly on Wednesdays)
* We categorize patients as “vaccinated” once they have received the required primary dose(s) of a COVID-19 vaccine and 2 weeks have passed since the final dose. At this time, we do not require that patients have booster doses to be categorized as fully vaccinated. An increase in break-through infections is expected as the Omicron variant spreads and immunity wanes among those who are high-risk and those who have not yet gotten a booster dose. COVID-19 vaccinations and booster shots are still the most effective method in preventing severe illness and hospitalization.
SMH positivity rate: 2.3% (2.8% for week ending March 4, 2022)
Total number of patients treated since outbreak began.
Patient admissions: 6,404 (6,403 yesterday)
Patient deaths: 646 (646 yesterday)
