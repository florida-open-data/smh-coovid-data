info_date: 2021-09-09T00:00:00Sarasota Memorial continues to monitor COVID-19 indicators and issues in our community and region. We are working closely with public health officials to identify and report important data trends in our health system. Please note that the information on this page is updated daily, Monday - Friday (except holidays).
Note that SMH has changed how we display the COVID-19 patient data below (effective Sept. 8, 2021).
Now, in addition to the COVID-positive patients currently hospitalized, the "COVID Patients Total" also includes those who have cleared the infectious stage, based on CDC and hospital guidelines. While these patients are no longer considered COVID-positive or infectious, many have serious medical issues complicating their recovery or discharge. Previously, when COVID patients cleared the infectious stage, SMH moved them from the daily COVID-positive patient category to the cumulative number of "Patients Treated/Discharged."
This change reflects the increasing number of COVID patients who remain hospitalized for weeks or even months due to lung damage, renal failure or other medical issues preventing a safe discharge, and their impact on our hospital census and capacity.
Here is today’s summary:
Today’s patient census: 785
Today's COVID patients total: 246 (250 yesterday)
Includes 49 COVID patients cleared of infection but still hospitalized due to complications delaying recovery/discharge.
Today’s ICU census: 96 (103 yesterday)
COVID patients in ICU today: 72 (76 yesterday)
Includes 17 COVID patients cleared of infection but still hospitalized due to complications delaying recovery/discharge.
% Unvaccinated COVID patients in the hospital: 85%
